Basics
------
.. warning::
    Make sure to install pyeconomy before doing anything with it to avoid any issues. Check the reference :ref:`here <Installing>`

After you installed **pyeconomy** you can finally make your dream economy program!
Basic setup:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyeconomy as economy

    instance = economy.Economy()

Notice what we did here: we created the basic instance of our economy class. Now lets do somrthing with it
Baisc program, that checks if the user exists and prints it's balance:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyeconomy as economy

    instance = economy.Economy()

    user_id = input("What is your ID: ")

    try:
        user = instance.get_user_by_id(user_id)
        print(f"Your name is: {user.name} and you have {user.wallet}$ in your wallet")
    except:
        print("User with that ID doesn't exist!")

We use ``instance.get_user_by_id(user_id)`` to a ``economy.EconomyUser`` object. Then we can print it's name and bank balance
Well, if we could check for users we can also create users:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyeconomy as economy

    instance = economy.Economy()

    user_name = input("Whats your name: ")
    user = economy.create_user(user_name)
    print("User created!")

    user_id = input("What is your ID: ")

    try:
        user = instance.get_user_by_id(user_id)
        print(f"Your name is: {user.name} and you have {user.wallet}$ in your wallet")
    except:
        print("User with that ID doesn't exist!")

We added just 3 lines of code and we can create users!

.. warning::
    We don't use ``instance.create_user(name)`` instead of this we use ``economy.create_user(name)``. 
    This is because create_user is not in ``economy.Economy`` but in ``economy.types.user`` that is imported to use in ``economy`` main file.
